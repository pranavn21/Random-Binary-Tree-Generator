# Random-Binary-Tree-Generator
This program converts text to Book nodes, and generates an AVL trees based on their ISBN numbers. Then, it generates a second (random) binary tree, and identifies if the generated tree is a BST and/or AVL tree.

Note: There are two input files because input2.txt will be way more likely to produce a BST/AVL tree. (Since the randomness decides where to place the number in the tree)
